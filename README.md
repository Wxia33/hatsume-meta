# Hatsume-meta
Support repo for hatsume for research on how best to find highlights in game videos

Below are some of the approaches being explored

## Bi-directional LSTM

Use Inception v3 network to first extract features from frames, then feed to BiRNN structure

## Pogchampnet

Individually analyzes frames for excitement value

Naive approach that can be straightforward to implement in webapp
